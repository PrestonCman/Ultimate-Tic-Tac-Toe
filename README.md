# Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
Group project ultimate tic tac toe online game.


I uploaded my UI code for the time being.  Figured it should be shared at this point mainly so no one ends up duplicating.  If there are any changes you'd like to make or want to bring up I am all ears.  Learning as I go, the way UI is set up in C# is kinda different.  I am having to take a very different approach.
